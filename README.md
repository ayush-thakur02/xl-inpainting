## Usage

To use Stable Diffusion XL Inpainting, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python inpaint.py
```

This command will launch the application, and a Gradio link will appear, allowing you to interactively inpaint images using the Stable Diffusion generative model. Gradio provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for selecting input images, specifying masks, and instantly generating inpainted results. It streamlines the inpainting process and makes it accessible to users with minimal technical expertise.
